This bot is an all-purpose discord butler that's able to be customized to suit specific server needs.
Below is a list with currently implemented features and if available, commands to get more information.

`# Diceroller`
Standard diceroller which works with the 1dX notation. See `!help roll` for more information on syntax and options.

`# GIF embeds`
For servers that want to disable embeds for any reason (triggers, unwanted imagery, etc), this function will make sure that (for specific channels configured in the config) gif URLs are picked up by the bot and embedded. This whole functionality is used for a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place, but because GIFs are linked to the Embed setting in Discord, for some servers this might pose a solution.

`# LARP Zomer Festival Babbelbingo`
For the LARP Zomer Festival babbelbingo, you can use the `!bingo` command anywhere on the LARP Platform Discord Server. You will get a Babbelbingo card in PM. You can use the `!bingo` command again for a new card if your old one is done or if you want a new one with other questions.
